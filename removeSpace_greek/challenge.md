Given a string containing many consecutive spaces, trim all spaces so that all words should contain only a single space between them. The conversion should be done in-place and solution should handle trailing and leading spaces and also remove preceding spaces before common punctuation like full stop, comma and a question mark.

Examples: 

Input: 
str = "   Hello Geeks . Welcome   to  GeeksforGeeks   .    ";
Output: 
"Hello Geeks. Welcome to GeeksforGeeks."
Input: 
str = "GeeksforGeeks";
Output: 
"GeeksforGeeks"
(No change is needed)
